## Why I made this ?
My personal void to share some thoughts and ideas, sometimes it might get really silly, funny or technical (who knows). Also since sharing is caring, I wanted to explain my thoughts in a simple way that my future me could understand, coz I easily forget things.

## Skills
While I don't believe that one's skills can be accurately measured by the number of programming languages one knows, but rather by the number of problems one has solved/faced, I would like to share some of the programming languages I have experience with based on my GitHub projects. Additionally, I am proficient at switching between languages seamlessly
