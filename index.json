Can you hack it? is a challenge hosted by AIS - ainfosec to give participants a chance to join the team. Score a total of 700 points to unlock the ability to submit your score. Your score submission and email will be sent directly to AIS and someone will be in touch. I like challenges, that’s why I am trying to give it a shot, while I might not solve them all, but I will be learning alot by time I give up. Before getting started!!!

UKW B is indeed the reflector being used. 3 of 5 Rotors it’s not clear what does that mean but I guess it’s the number of used rotors.

Now askfm nuked it, and made it only available for the mobile users (really!) with huge differences (it’s called chat now): Anyone can reply to the question with anything without the permission of account owner!!! Can’t reply with images as account owner. Anyway, I am not here to convince you to leave askfm, I have a history of creating askfm bots and auto_repliers, when I logged into my very old account (which is deleted now btw) I tried to view a thread and I wasn’t be able to do so (had to install the application on my phone).

So I tried many mobile application to inspect the traffic but nothing worked !!. That’s why I switched to using proxy applications like charles but it didn’t work! (i don’t remember why!). Lastly found this awesome, game changer, program: HTTPToolKit but this need to run inside a VM, so I installed Genymotion(coz you know, I am lazy) Installing askfm on a VM I wasn’t be able to install the application on the VM on the first try to I had to do some tricks: I modified the buildprobs at : /system/build.prop and removed all the VM traces by Genymotion.

HTTPToolKit in VM HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) is a specific type of message authentication code that involves hashing a message with a secret key to produce a fixed-size output, which can be used to verify the integrity and authenticity of the message. HMAC is commonly used for authentication and integrity checking in various security protocols and applications, such as in web services, API authentication, and data transmission. How HMAC authorization works is simple: How HMAC Works ? So basically, there are 2 steps that the application does to send a HTTP Request: Key Generation : The key should be in the app and the server agrees on using that key. HMAC Calculation: The app calculates the HMAC by applying a specific cryptographic hash function (SHA-1) to the message and the secret key. The result of this calculation is a fixed-size hash value which is then send in the headers as : Authorization: HMAC \u003chash\u003e So all we have to do now it just find the KEY and how the app generates the HMAC hash!

For this propose I used Jadx which is a command line and GUI tool for producing Java source code from Android Dex and Apk file, jadx can’t decompile all 100% of the code, so errors will occur.

The modifications stashed away by this command can be listed with git stash list, inspected with git stash show, and restored (potentially on top of a different commit) with git stash apply. Calling git stash without any arguments is equivalent to git stash push Tip You can interactively choose which changes to stash when using git stash -p 2. git cherry-pickApply the changes introduced by some existing commits to your repo. git cherry-pick is a very useful command to use in case you want to have some commits to be picked by reference and added to the current working HEAD. git cherry-pick can be useful for: Applying hotfixs: When you want to apply a hotfix in one branch to other branches. Selectively merging changes: When you want to merge only specific commits from one branch into another, rather than merging the entire branch. Reordering commits: You can use git cherry-pick to reorder commits in the target branch or even apply commits from different parts of the source branch to achieve a specific commit order. Don't use it if:- When commits depend on each other: If the commits you want to cherry-pick have dependencies on other commits in the source branch, cherry-picking them individually can lead to errors or missing context Maintaining a clean commit history: Cherry-picking can lead to a less clean and linear commit history, as it introduces commits from another branch with different commit messages and timestamps. 2. git blameView the revision history of a file, showing who last modified each line and when. It’s a useful tool for tracking changes and identifying the author and commit associated with each line of code in a file. When git blame can be useful: Bug Tracking: When trying to identify the source of a bug, you can trace back commits. Security Auditing: For security-conscious projects, git blame can be employed to trace when and by whom security-related changes were made, aiding in security audits and investigations. HacksWhen you are interested in finding the origin for lines 40-60 for file foobar: git blame -L 40,+21 foo A particularly useful way is to see if an added file has lines created by copy-and-paste from existing files. Sometimes this indicates that the developer was being sloppy and did not refactor the code properly. You can first find the commit that introduced the file with: git log --diff-filter=A --pretty=short -- foo and then annotate the change between the commit and its parents, using commit^! notation: git blame -C -C -f $commit^! -- foo git annotate The only difference between this command and git blame is that they use slightly different output formats. 3. git bisectUse binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug in your code. This command uses a binary search algorithm to find which commit in your project’s history introduced a bug. You use it by first telling it a “bad” commit that is known to contain the bug, and a “good” commit that is known to be before the bug was introduced.

Selectively merging changes: When you want to merge only specific commits from one branch into another, rather than merging the entire branch.
