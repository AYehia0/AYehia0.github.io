Askfm was something cute when almost few people (those who had opinios about everything) used it, now it became a monster, turned into an ad targeting application with many features that ruined the application : like coins (the first stupid thing), then many more stupid featues and many people used the application the wrong way (you know what I mean if you’re using it now).

Back in time, threads was the best feature, you basically send a question to something with replies inside it, the reply isn’t shown unless the owner publish it with answer. Replying with an image was a thing! Now askfm nuked it, and made it only available for the mobile users (really!) with huge differences (it’s called chat now): Anyone can reply to the question with anything without the permission of account owner!!! Can’t reply with images as account owner. Anyway, I am not here to convince you to leave askfm, I have a history of creating askfm bots and auto_repliers, when I logged into my very old account (which is deleted now btw) I tried to view a thread and I wasn’t be able to do so (had to install the application on my phone). So I thought it would be a great idea to have some sort of a web extension to just show the questions/replies under a question. In this blog, I am sharing my journey to do so!

So I tried many mobile application to inspect the traffic but nothing worked !!. That’s why I switched to using proxy applications like charles but it didn’t work! (i don’t remember why!). Lastly found this awesome, game changer, program: HTTPToolKit but this need to run inside a VM, so I installed Genymotion(coz you know, I am lazy) Installing askfm on a VM I wasn’t be able to install the application on the VM on the first try to I had to do some tricks: I modified the buildprobs at : /system/build.prop and removed all the VM traces by Genymotion.

HTTPToolKit in VM HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) is a specific type of message authentication code that involves hashing a message with a secret key to produce a fixed-size output, which can be used to verify the integrity and authenticity of the message. HMAC is commonly used for authentication and integrity checking in various security protocols and applications, such as in web services, API authentication, and data transmission. How HMAC authorization works is simple: How HMAC Works ? So basically, there are 2 steps that the application does to send a HTTP Request: Key Generation : The key should be in the app and the server agrees on using that key. HMAC Calculation: The app calculates the HMAC by applying a specific cryptographic hash function (SHA-1) to the message and the secret key. The result of this calculation is a fixed-size hash value which is then send in the headers as : Authorization: HMAC \u003chash\u003e So all we have to do now it just find the KEY and how the app generates the HMAC hash! (easy?).

Selectively merging changes: When you want to merge only specific commits from one branch into another, rather than merging the entire branch. Reordering commits: You can use git cherry-pick to reorder commits in the target branch or even apply commits from different parts of the source branch to achieve a specific commit order. Don't use it if:- When commits depend on each other: If the commits you want to cherry-pick have dependencies on other commits in the source branch, cherry-picking them individually can lead to errors or missing context Maintaining a clean commit history: Cherry-picking can lead to a less clean and linear commit history, as it introduces commits from another branch with different commit messages and timestamps. 2. git blameView the revision history of a file, showing who last modified each line and when. It’s a useful tool for tracking changes and identifying the author and commit associated with each line of code in a file. When git blame can be useful: Bug Tracking: When trying to identify the source of a bug, you can trace back commits.

Selectively merging changes: When you want to merge only specific commits from one branch into another, rather than merging the entire branch. Reordering commits: You can use git cherry-pick to reorder commits in the target branch or even apply commits from different parts of the source branch to achieve a specific commit order. Don't use it if:- When commits depend on each other: If the commits you want to cherry-pick have dependencies on other commits in the source branch, cherry-picking them individually can lead to errors or missing context Maintaining a clean commit history: Cherry-picking can lead to a less clean and linear commit history, as it introduces commits from another branch with different commit messages and timestamps. 2. git blameView the revision history of a file, showing who last modified each line and when.

When git blame can be useful: Bug Tracking: When trying to identify the source of a bug, you can trace back commits.
