# Linux And Other Cool Things


Life is a long journey of learning and experience, once you stop learning you die!, also sharing is caring.
That's why I am sharing this thing :D

# Cool Things

`Cool Things` is a long journey of adventure, fun and experience about silly technical things I didn't know it existed and made my life easier (or not, but cool for sure). For now, I don't know how to categorize them but I will try my best not to make things messy as possible.

{{< admonition warning "Why it's like that ?" >}}
This list isn't sorted 
{{< /admonition >}}

I am using all these tools in Linux (Arch BTW) but it should work on other OSs.
You should use linux, if you don't, for making the best of your hardware and have the power to do anything you want.
Here you will find tips, tricks, shortcuts, apps and utils making my OS experience fun and effective. 

## Linux Experience

{{< image src="rice.gif" caption="Credits : github/thomas10-10" >}}

I am using linux as my main machine for work and fun, while I also have windows installed but I use it rarly for gaming. For that, I tried many linux flavours (DE - Desktop Environment) but most of them didn't meet my own requirements so I learnt about [WMs - Windwo Managers](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Window_manager)

So what's the WM I use ? : `bspwm`
If you want to read more about how to choose your next `WM`, I recommend you to read this [Unixporn wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/wiki/choosing_a_wm/list/)

{{< admonition tip "My Bspwm Setup" >}}
You can find my setup on my github.

### Others

## Be A Wizard
Showing the practical things I have learnt in a specific technology, again IDK how to categorize. So I will just put things based on the technology.

### Vim
1. <b>Vim navigations inside command mode #1</b>:
- `q:`
Opens up a vim buffer at the bottom of the current screen, allowing you to enter commands and navigate just like vi.

2. <b>Vim navigations inside command mode #2</b>:
- Opening the command mode, and pressing `C-f` opens a buffer at the bottom of the screen just like <b>#1</b>.

3. <b>Capitalize/Lowercase characters</b>:
- `gU`, `gu`
You can combine them with other shortcuts, example you want to make the text inside <> uppercase!:
    - `<hello, world>` -> `gUi<` -> `<HELLO, WORLD>`

### Ranger
1. <b>Extracting archives inside ranger</b>: `1l`
