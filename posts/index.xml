            </div>Getting StartedBefore Starting, it&rsquo;s a good idea to install a Custom ROM for your old device just to get the best out of it. Head to XDA and search for your device. But why you might ask ?
The installed custom ROM would bring you newer Android version + new kernel version. (not always) Root access (more control in general). In my case, I am using SM-T585 which came with Android 8.]]></description>

            </div>Using the github website
Probably this is the easiest way to download files from github, by navigating to the file on github and click on the download button. Unfortenitaly, it&rsquo;s not the fastest, you will have to move the file to the desired destination and doesn&rsquo;t work for raw files like (txt and .ext).
Using wget/curlNow we talk :D, here&rsquo;s a bash function (add to your alias section) I wrote to automate the download process by using the URL which contains blob keyword.]]></description>

            </div>Why you should use tmux ?Tmux is a terminal multiplexer, it lets you switch easily between several programs in one terminal, detach them (they keep running in the background) and re-attach them to a different terminal.
It also allows you to have multiple panes open at the same time, each with their own shell running, with a single SSH connection (yes, it supports SSH). Not only that, you can also have multiple windows open at the same time, a bit like tabs with more panes in them.]]></description>
