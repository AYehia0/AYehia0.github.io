            </div>Why you should use tmux ?Tmux is a terminal multiplexer, it lets you switch easily between several programs in one terminal, detach them (they keep running in the background) and re-attach them to a different terminal.
It also allows you to have multiple panes open at the same time, each with their own shell running, with a single SSH connection (yes, it supports SSH). Not only that, you can also have multiple windows open at the same time, a bit like tabs with more panes in them.]]></description>
